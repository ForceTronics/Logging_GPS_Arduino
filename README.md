# Logging_GPS_Arduino
This example Arduino sketch and library are from a video tutorial on YouTube called "Logging GPS Data to an SD Card with Arduino." Note that the code is setup for a non-AVR Arduino so you need to go to the .cpp file and comment out one of the library files (its noted in the code)
